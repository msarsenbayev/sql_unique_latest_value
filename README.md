# sql_unique_latest_value
SQL code to output only unique values with latest date.

In some cases you want to create a list of unique values from your register only with latest values. For example, in my case it was a register where one equipment could be tested more than two times. And I had to know only the latest result. But if there are thousands of rows of data it gets hard to check it manually. We used to manually write "latest" on "latest" column. But sometimes people forget to update it. So, this sql code was the solution. 

Any suggestions and improvements are most welcome.
Thank you.
